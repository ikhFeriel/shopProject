        The adaptation of the workstation is the obligation imposed on 
        the employer in certain situations to adapt the workstation of 
        an employee to their state of health: pregnant women, after a

        The adaptation of the workstation can take various forms:
        part-time activity most often, reduction in pace or workload,
